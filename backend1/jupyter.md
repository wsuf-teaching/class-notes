Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows us to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive computing environment where we can write and execute code in a step-by-step manner. We can write Python code (as well as code in other programming languages with appropriate kernels installed) and see the results immediately, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.

In addition to code execution, Jupyter Notebook supports rich output formats, including Markdown, HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and more. This allows us to create interactive visualizations, plots, and multimedia content directly within our notebook.

These notebook files are self-contained documents that can be easily shared with others. We can share your notebooks as static HTML files, PDFs, or even as live documents via services like JupyterHub, GitHub, or Jupyter Notebooks on Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform. Multiple users can collaborate on the same notebook simultaneously, making it great for team projects and collaborative research.
